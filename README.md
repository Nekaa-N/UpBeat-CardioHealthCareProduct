With several Machine Learning algorithms, this model is trained to predict the accuracy of heart stroke pf indivisuals.

DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, we don't use it for making health decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL into precision predicting if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

MOTIVATION üí™

A stroke is a life-changing event ‚Äî physically and emotionally. A stroke can make everyday activities challenging. These challenges may be due to several stroke-related conditions, such as limb weakness, numbness or paralysis, communication challenges, vision challenges and one-side neglect challenges.

This project, presents a website in which the stroke can be predicted based on the data given by the user.

In this stroke prediction application, the user can provide the health data from their side and the application will predict if the person with such health status can acquire stroke.
